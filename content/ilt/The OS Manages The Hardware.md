## 1) Layered view of a computer system

the os is a piece of software  that is setting between the applications programs and the hardware

the role of the os is 
1) Protect the hardware from misuse by runaway the applications
2) provide application with simple and uniform mechanisms 

## 2) Abstractions provided by an operating system



**files** are abstraction for I/O devices
**virtual memory** is an abstraction for the main memory + I/O devices
**Processes** are abstraction for processor + main memory + I/O devices
